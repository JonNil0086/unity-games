# Games that I've made in Unity

# Box Crusher
I saw many different games in the genre of throwing balls on different objects, and I wanted to make my own interpretation of a game in that genre.
Since I also wanted to make a mobile game, the result was Box Crusher.<br>
Box Crusher is a game where you launch balls and crush boxes to gain score. Pop powerups to increase the amount of balls you have in the
current and/or next round.

This game was made for Android / PC.
